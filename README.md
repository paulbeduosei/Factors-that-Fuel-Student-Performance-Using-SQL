# Factors-that-Fuel-Student-Performance
Just completed a SQL project exploring what truly drives student exam performance — and it turned out to be one of my favorite analyses yet.

Using the student_performance dataset, I queried relationships between study hours, sleep patterns, attendance, extracurriculars, and lifestyle factors to uncover which variables have the strongest impact on academic outcomes.

This project reinforced how powerful SQL can be for extracting insights from complex datasets and how data can guide smarter decisions for students, educators, and policymakers.
